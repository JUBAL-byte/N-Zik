/**
 * Timber tree that appends every DEBUG-and-above line to [logFile] without doing any disk I/O
 * on the thread that logs (issue #606, Goal M14).
 *
 * [log] only queues an entry into an unbounded channel: it never blocks and never drops a line.
 * A single consumer on [dispatcher] drains the queue in batches, formats the lines, opens the
 * file in append mode, writes the batch, closes it, then applies the size rule ([trimLogFile]).
 * The file is deliberately re-opened for every batch and never kept open, because the Rescue
 * Center and the "debug log" setting delete it from the outside while the tree is planted.
 *
 * A batch that cannot be written stays in memory and is retried, in order, with the next batch.
 * The only loss is a persistent write failure: beyond [maxPendingSize] characters waiting, the
 * oldest waiting lines are abandoned. The writer never calls Timber (that would loop back into
 * this tree).
 *
 * Kept a [Timber.DebugTree] so the tag is still inferred from the call stack, on the caller
 * thread, before [log] is reached.
