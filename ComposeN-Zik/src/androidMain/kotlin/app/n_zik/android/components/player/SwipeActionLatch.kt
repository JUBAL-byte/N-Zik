/**
 * Lets a swipe action run once per gesture.
 *
 * `SwipeToDismissBox` calls `confirmValueChange` again on every drag delta once the finger reaches
 * the end anchor (the state never settles because the callback answers false), so an action placed
 * there ran once per pixel of movement. [tryFire] answers true for the first call only; [release]
 * rearms it once the gesture is over.
 *
 * [isFired] is observable: the swipe is switched off while it is true, which ends a drag that the
 * finger keeps alive so the box can return to its position without waiting for the release.
 *
 * Not thread-safe: meant to be used from the main thread, like the gesture callbacks.
